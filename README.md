# Binary Signing and GitHub Uploader

This script automates the process of signing a binary with GPG, generating a timestamp for both the binary and signature, and uploading the files to GitHub. Additionally, it provides a message containing the SHA256 hash of the binary and instructions for verifying the timestamp files.

## Features

- Signs a binary using GPG.
- Generates a timestamp for both the binary and the signature.
- Uploads the signed binary, signature, and timestamp files to GitHub.
- Outputs a message with the SHA256 hash and verification instructions.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have GPG and keys available.
2. Run the script with your binary as input.
3. The script will generate the following files:
   - The original binary
   - The GPG signature (`.sig`)
   - The timestamp files (`.ts1`, `.ts2`)
4. These files are uploaded to a GitHub repository.
5. A message containing the SHA256 hash and verification details will be provided.

## Verifying the Signature and Timestamp

- To verify the GPG signature:
  ```sh
  gpg --verify binary-file.sig binary-file
